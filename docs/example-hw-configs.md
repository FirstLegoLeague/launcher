## Large competition with iPads or tablets

Same configuration as [Large Competition](#large-competition) except that iPads are used by referees for score entry.

Note: Since this software is still new and we don't have sufficient experience recording the match results on iPads only, we suggest that you use papers scoresheets in addition to the digital scoresheets.

The two scorekeeper computers are unnecessary if score entry is done on iPads only.

If score entry is done on iPads and paper scoresheets then scorekeepers can verify that the paper and digital scoresheets are consistent.
